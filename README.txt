## Capstone project description:

For the capstone project, I will combine the CDC's survey of Behavioral Risk Factors for the years 2003 - 2019 and the MSU's collection of Correlates of State Policy to answer the following questions:

1. What are the socioecnomic and geographic factors that are predictive versus protective against common behavioral risks?
2. Are there any public policies that are predictive versus protective against common behavioral risks?
3. It is possible to detect public policies that acted as interventions and either had a positive or negative impact on these behavioral risks?

Answering these questions will provide us with a better understanding of the context from which common behavioral risks such as smoking, binge drinking, vaccination and lack of exercise can rise. In addition, we will also be able to see whether there are certain ways we can target these risk factors, to encourage people to engage in them less. Although the main mode of intervention studied is public policy, we can also apply this to the private sector, since I'll be able to demonstrate the kind of dataset and analysis methodologies that will be necessary to design decisions that could positively impact people's behavior.
